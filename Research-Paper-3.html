      <div class="section">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          The United Kingdom manages an ageing stock of steel bridges that are critical to national transport
          infrastructure. Traditional inspection methods rely heavily on manual visual surveys, which are
          time-consuming, costly, hazardous, and subject to human bias. This research interest explores the
          integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to
          automate and enhance damage detection in UK steel bridges.
        </p>
        <p>
          By leveraging high-resolution drone imagery, computer vision, and deep learning models, the study
          aims to identify, classify, and quantify common steel bridge defects such as corrosion, fatigue
          cracking, section loss, and coating degradation. The research seeks to improve inspection accuracy,
          reduce lifecycle costs, and support data-driven maintenance decision-making aligned with UK bridge
          management standards.

      <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The UK bridge network includes thousands of steel bridges constructed during the late 19th and
          mid-20th centuries. Many of these structures are now operating beyond their original design life,
          facing increased loading demands and environmental exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current inspection practices, as outlined in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB),
          primarily depend on periodic visual inspections. These inspections often require lane closures,
          scaffolding, or rope access, leading to safety risks and operational disruption. Advances in drone
          technology and AI provide an opportunity to transform bridge inspection into a safer, faster, and
          more objective process.

      <!-- DAMAGE MECHANISMS -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Common Damage Mechanisms in UK Steel Bridges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Corrosion:</strong> General corrosion, pitting, and section loss due to moisture, de-icing salts, and marine exposure.</li>
          <li><strong>Fatigue Cracking:</strong> Cracks at welded details, riveted connections, and stress concentration zones.</li>
          <li><strong>Coating Failure:</strong> Paint delamination and breakdown accelerating corrosion processes.</li>
          <li><strong>Deformation:</strong> Buckling or distortion of steel members caused by overloading or impact.</li>
          <li><strong>Connection Defects:</strong> Loose, missing, or deteriorated bolts and rivets.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- DRONE SYSTEMS -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Drone-Based Inspection Systems</h2>
        <p>
          UAVs equipped with advanced sensors enable close-range inspection of hard-to-access bridge components.
          Typical drone payloads include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>High-resolution RGB cameras for visual defect detection</li>
          <li>Thermal cameras for moisture ingress and delamination assessment</li>
          <li>LiDAR sensors for geometry capture and deformation analysis</li>
          <li>RTK-GNSS and inertial navigation for accurate georeferencing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Drone inspections significantly reduce inspection time and eliminate the need for scaffolding or
          traffic disruption, making them particularly suitable for busy UK transport corridors.
        </p>

      <!-- AI METHODS -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>4. AI and Computer Vision Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          AI-driven damage detection relies on machine learning and deep learning algorithms trained on
          annotated bridge imagery. Key techniques include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> For image classification and defect recognition</li>
          <li><strong>Object Detection Models:</strong> YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and SSD for locating defects</li>
          <li><strong>Semantic Segmentation:</strong> Pixel-level damage mapping using U-Net or DeepLab</li>
          <li><strong>Transfer Learning:</strong> Adapting pre-trained models to bridge-specific datasets</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These models can automatically classify damage severity and generate condition ratings compatible
          with existing asset management systems.
        </p>

      <!-- DATASETS -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Acquisition and Training Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          A major challenge in AI-based bridge inspection is the availability of high-quality labelled data.
          UK-specific steel bridge datasets are limited due to data ownership, safety constraints, and
          variability in bridge typologies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Limited publicly available steel bridge defect datasets</li>
          <li>Class imbalance between damaged and undamaged regions</li>
          <li>Variability in lighting, weather, and surface conditions</li>
          <li>Need for expert annotation by structural engineers</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- REGULATORY -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          Drone operations in the UK must comply with Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations, including
          airspace restrictions, pilot certification, and data privacy laws. Additionally, AI systems used
          in safety-critical infrastructure must be transparent, explainable, and auditable.

          AI-driven drone-based inspection represents a transformative approach to managing the UK’s ageing
          steel bridge infrastructure. By improving inspection efficiency, safety, and objectivity, this
