          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of my interested research areas which explores geotechnical challenges in bridge foundations in Papua New Guinea (PNG), a country with complex terrain, limited infrastructure, and growing demand for resilient transport systems. It evaluates materials, design strategies, and policy frameworks that promote environmental stewardship and long-term economic viability.

          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Papua New Guinea, located in the southwestern Pacific, faces unique challenges in road development due to its mountainous topography, high rainfall, and remote communities. Despite significant investment in transport infrastructure, many roads remain unpaved or deteriorate rapidly due to poor construction standards and climate exposure.

          <h2>2. Sustainable Construction Principles</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use of Local Materials:</strong> Promotes cost-efficiency and reduces carbon footprint.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate-Resilient Design:</strong> Incorporates drainage, slope stabilization, and erosion control.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Ensures roads meet local needs and are maintained post-construction.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifecycle Costing:</strong> Evaluates long-term maintenance and environmental impact.</li>

          <h2>3. Case Study: Highlands Highway Rehabilitation</h2>
          <p>
            The Highlands Highway, a critical economic corridor, has undergone multiple upgrades to improve connectivity between Lae and Mount Hagen. Recent projects emphasize slope protection, culvert installation, and asphalt overlays using polymer-modified bitumen for durability.

          <h2>4. GIS and Mapping Tools</h2>
          <p>
            Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are essential for planning sustainable road networks. Tools like QGIS and Google Earth allow engineers to visualize terrain, identify flood-prone zones, and optimize route alignment.

          <h2>5. Policy and Funding Landscape</h2>
          <p>
            PNG’s Medium Term Development Plan (MTDP IV) prioritizes sustainable infrastructure. International donors such as the ADB and World Bank support climate-adaptive road projects, while local agencies are encouraged to adopt green procurement standards.

          <h2>6. Geotechnical Challenges in Bridge Foundations</h2>
          <p>
            Bridge foundations in Papua New Guinea face significant geotechnical challenges driven by varied soil conditions, heavy rainfall, and seismic activity. These factors affect foundation selection, long-term stability, and maintenance requirements for bridges across rivers and in mountainous terrain.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Variable and Soft Soils:</strong> Extensive areas of peat, soft alluvium, and residual clays require deep foundations or ground improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>High Rainfall & Saturation:</strong> Persistent wet conditions reduce soil strength and increase the risk of slope failures and settlements.</li>
            <li><strong>Scour & Erosion:</strong> Rivers with high seasonal flows cause channel migration and bed erosion around piers and abutments.</li>
            <li><strong>Seismic Risk:</strong> Earthquake-prone zones raise concerns about liquefaction and dynamic foundation response.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Site Investigation:</strong> Remote locations and access constraints often limit geotechnical data, increasing design uncertainty.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Typical mitigation measures include deep pile foundations (driven or bored), stone columns and other ground improvement techniques, scour protection (riprap, gabions, or sheet piles), thorough site investigation (CPTs and boreholes), and monitoring systems to support maintenance planning.

          <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Sustainable road construction in PNG requires a multidisciplinary approach—blending engineering innovation, environmental awareness, and community participation. With strategic investment and policy alignment, PNG can build resilient roads that support inclusive growth and climate adaptation.
